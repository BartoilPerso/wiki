## Basic information

The OpenIPC is an alternative [firmware](https://github.com/OpenIPC) for IP cameras and a kind of umbrella for other projects that are components of our system.

The OpenIPC is a Linux operating system based on Buildroot/OpenWrt projects and targeting IP cameras with chipsets from different vendors, starting with Goke GK72xx, HiSilicon Hi35xx, SigmaStar SSC33x, and XiongmaiTech XM5xx.

Everyone is welcome and can use/contribute to the project in any way they find useful!

We would be grateful for the feedback and suggestions.
